##class 1:

Quest 1: Open the hello-world app again. Can make a button that hides and shows everything else on the page? Can you include a picture of something incredible (a baby hippo?) and a button (<button>Show me something magical</button>) that shows and hides the baby hippo?

Quest 2: Open the hello-world app again. Can you refactor it to use a controller and $scope instead of ng-init? (hint: look at example1 app for controller syntax).

Quest 3: In the hello-world app, can you rig up a second input element and link it to a different part of the view? Instead of a text input box, try check boxes, radio buttons, number fields, or other inputs.

Quest 4: In the hello-world app, can you use JavaScript to capitalize any input made to the box? User types 'world' but the H1 displays 'WORLD' or 'World'. (hint: Angular calls this kind of text transformation a filter, and you can use [pre-built angular filters](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/uppercase) or [roll your own](http://codepen.io/WinterJoey/pen/sfFaK).)

Quest 5: In the example1 app, there is a remoteUsers form to add another user to the list. Can you expand this form with more input boxes and more fields on the person object? How about a number input box for age? (Bonus challenge: can you set it to validate the age input and not accept ages over 120 or under 18?) Can you add email and password inputs?

Quest 6: Can you use ng-hide and ng-show to switch between showing remote users and local users?

Quest 7: Can you use the example1 project as a basis to build a rudimentary online dating app or puppy adoption service? Think about what fields you would need on the person object, and make a form to create more of them. Can you use the input field (with ng-model) or a series of input fields to search the list for specific kinds of puppies or people? How can you set an input box to only search inside a specific field on the object? Check out the documentation for [$filter](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/filter) and bring your questions to class.
